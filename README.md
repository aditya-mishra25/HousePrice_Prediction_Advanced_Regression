## General Information
- Though this problem can be solved by other algorithms like decision trees, we have used linear regression and have used ridge and lasso to tackel overfitting.
- taking into consideration lots and lots of variables we are predicting the house price.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Lasso regression helps us select features which makes the model simpler.
- Conclusion 2 Lasso penalizes the model more compared to Ridge when it comes to using more number of variables.
- Conclusion 3 Transforming the Target Variable can help you establish linearity with the predictors.
